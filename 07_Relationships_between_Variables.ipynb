    "1. The scatterplot shows a weak relationship between the variables but it is hard to see clearly.\n",
    "2. The correlations support this.  Pearson's is around 0.07, Spearman's is around 0.09.  The difference between them suggests some influence of outliers or a non-linear relationsip.\n",
    "3. Plotting percentiles of weight versus age suggests that the relationship is non-linear.  Birth weight increases more quickly in the range of mother's age from 15 to 25.  After that, the effect is weaker."

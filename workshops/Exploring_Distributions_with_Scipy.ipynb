    "- An event either occurs or does not, that is, there are no half-events.\n",
    "- The average number of events per the time period being considered is known.\n",
    "- An event should have the same probability of occurring at any point in the time period. For example, it should not be more likely to occur at the start of a day than at the end of a day.\n",
    "- Each event is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any number of events could occur during the time period being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions need not hold perfectly for the Poisson distribution to be a good model, but they need to hold at least approximately. For instance, while it is technically true that the number of people doing some task over a given time period does not satisfy the last condition (as there are a finite number of people on the planet), for all practical purposes the condition holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is described by a single parameter $\\lambda$. This value represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average number of events over a given time period\n",
    "- the variance for number of events over a given time period\n",

    "\n",
    "&lambda; is called a parameter of the distribution, and it controls the distribution's shape. For the Poisson distribution, &lambda; can be any positive number. By increasing &lambda;, we add more probability to larger values, and conversely by decreasing &lambda; we add more probability to smaller values. One can describe &lambda; as the intensity of the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful property of the Poisson distribution is that its expected value is equal to its parameter: $E[Z|\\lambda] = \\lambda$\n",

The number of players on a baseball team that get sick in a given week is bounded above by the number of players on the team, so it cannot be Poisson distributed. Additionally, the event of getting sick is likely not independent for each player, since teammates can infect each other.
